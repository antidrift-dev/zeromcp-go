# ZeroMCP &mdash; Ruby

Drop a `.rb` file in a folder, get a sandboxed MCP server. Stdio out of the box, zero dependencies.

## Getting started

```ruby
# tools/hello.rb — this is a complete MCP server
tool description: "Say hello to someone",
     input: { name: "string" }

execute do |args, ctx|
  "Hello, #{args['name']}!"
end
```

```sh
ruby -I lib bin/zeromcp serve ./tools
```

That's it. Stdio works immediately. Drop another `.rb` file to add another tool. Delete a file to remove one.

## vs. the official SDK

The official Ruby SDK requires server setup, transport configuration, and explicit tool registration. ZeroMCP is file-based &mdash; each tool is its own file, discovered automatically. Zero external dependencies.

The official SDK has **no sandbox**. ZeroMCP lets tools declare network, filesystem, and exec permissions.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.0+
- No external dependencies

## Install

```sh
gem build zeromcp.gemspec
gem install zeromcp-0.1.0.gem
```

## Sandbox

```ruby
tool description: "Fetch from our API",
     input: { url: "string" },
     permissions: {
       network: ["api.example.com", "*.internal.dev"],
       fs: false,
       exec: false
     }

execute do |args, ctx|
  # ...
end
```

## Directory structure

Tools are discovered recursively. Subdirectory names become namespace prefixes:

```
tools/
  hello.rb          -> tool "hello"
  math/
    add.rb          -> tool "math_add"
```

## Testing

```sh
ruby -I lib -I test -e 'Dir["test/**/*_test.rb"].each { |f| require_relative f }'
```
